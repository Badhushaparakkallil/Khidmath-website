    <h2>About Khidmath</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Khidmath</strong>  (meaning 'Service'), we believe that professional success and deeply held values are not mutually exclusive—they are the most powerful combination. We are a dedicated platform created to solve a critical need: connecting organizations committed to Islamic-valued principles with an exceptional pool of talent.
    </p>
    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>
      Our focus is exclusively on the distinguished Hudawi graduates of Darul Huda Islamic University, Chemmad. These graduates are unique. They not only possess robust modern skills in fields ranging from finance to technology, but they also carry a profound foundation in Islamic ethics and wisdom. This dual competence ensures that every employee hired through Khidmath brings not just technical expertise, but also unshakeable integrity, professionalism, and a service-oriented mindset to your workplace.
    </p>
    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>
      Founded by a team of alumni and educators, Khidmath was born from a simple yet profound realization: there was a gap between highly qualified, values-driven professionals and the organizations that desperately needed them.

For decades, Darul Huda Islamic University (DHIU), Chemmad, has upheld a unique educational vision, meticulously crafting graduates known as Hudawies. These individuals are trained not only to master modern, in-demand professional skills—from Islamic finance and media to education and technology—but also to internalize a deep, ethical framework rooted in Islamic scholarship.
